# Weekly Reports

## Week One

This week was all about introductions into the new academic year. I began with setting up all of my projects and printing all the assignment tasks, this along with a daily planner will help keep my time management in order. I cannot afford to fall behind this year as I am working with a BA team as one of two main programmers. This team-up will integrate with as many of my BSc assignments as possible. The only one that has linked up though as far as I know is the comp230 which I will be doing the mechanics of the game as my component in Unreal. Luckily over the summer I familiarised myself with unreal and am comfortable to work within the engine. On my first comp220 lecture I became quite worried about the amount of work required for the task at hand and am hoping as time goes on I can manage my time efficiently enough to dedicate enough time to each task. We were also set out with the UI evaluation which is our earliest deadline, so I will begin work on that immediately, alongside research for our ethics essay.

##Week Two

I am now in full swing, still getting to grips with the time management, this ill always be an issue. The best way to keep on top of everything is to ensure I understand the work needed and the time available, this is easier said than done. I have created a daily and weekly time schedule, it seem logical with a set amount of hours dedicated to each project. I must not spread myself too thinly across the projects, although having the deadlines at the end of the semester helps. After the second comp220 lecture my nerves are waning as the workload seems large I have been trying to work out a method to minimise the workload while maximising the grade, I cannot allow other projects to drastically interfere with my main group project. I will stick to my schedule for now and see how things turn out next week.

##Week Three

I came down with a cold this week, that along with having to travel long distance over last weekend prevented me from attending my comp230 lecture. I was able however to attend the other two lectures, to which I am very thankful for as the comp220 lecture paid off quite a bit, I am now pretty confident in the workload as Ed had helped lay the ground work for the project and it seems we only have to implement our own components instead of creating everything from scratch. The comp210 lecture was great, I had my first encounter with VR which was really fun, it has given me a lot of enthusiasm for the module, something I lacked before as I didn't think much of VR. I suspect many people feel the same if they haven't tried it. I was also informed of the peer review the following week which served as a good reminder to ensure the UI evaluation was done. So far time management ha been mostly successful the only assignment I haven't made progress on is the ethics essay, almost no research has been done on this, I hope to fix this issue within the next couple of weeks.

##Week Four

PERFORCE!!! This is my main blocker at this time, every attempt I have made to understand its working and get it working correctly has resulted in more confusion and frustration. I will be looking into GitHub Large File Storage as an alternative to this, as I am very familiar with how GitHub works. My time schedule is working quite well although my essay needs to catch up alongside my journal. Although I have a plan to get the journals done, I will treat them like and essay and gather resources together in one session and write my notes up on them. This will require a full day for each. The evaluation for the UI peer review did not go as well as expected as I was unprepared for the format that the peer review was done. We had to stand up and present our findings to the class, this would not have been a problem if I had known that this was the method that was going to be used. Next week I will definitely make some leeway on the ethics research.

##Week Five

The transition over to GitHub was a simple one, as long as the git ignore is set up correctly it all worked out. This has made the workflow a lot smoother not having to constantly fight perforce. For the short time that semester two has been going I have found it difficult to work on other subjects other than Project VoT. I cannot seem to make up my mind is it is the lack of interest in the graphics or the difficulty of it, either way it’s a struggle to get the project going. 

##Week Six

This week was a good week, except for a minor issue with the university computers and their admin privileges, Git LFS along with unreal had a glitch where a file saved too large and LFS couldn't pick it up. This issue was solved by repeating the process at home which fixed the size of the file as well as git LFS correctly tracking these files extensions. No progress so far has been made on my VR project. I have made an attempt at the comp220 graphics but am getting nowhere fast. I should ask for assistance for this module but I loath to ask for help when everyone else seems to be getting on well with their work contrary to what they say.

##Week Seven

I have made little progress this week other than a few things on my comp230. I'm not sure if I can continue with this course next year, I don't believe that I am quite cut out for it. Though I shall persevere for this year, I am considering leaving after next summer. 

##Week Eight

This week was not so different from last week, my projects are making little progress and its difficult to keep going. I will be going home to try and get the essay done, hopefully that will throw me into action for my other modules.

##Week Nine

This week I went home to write my essay, and get my head together, nothing had been done in the way of writing it even the bibliography hadn't been done. Luckily I managed to get both of these done that weekend. I believe that I was just procrastinating something that I didn't want to do so I just forced myself to get it done. I'm not sure where this lack of enthusiasm has come from as at the beginning of the semester I was very excited to get on with the course. This is something I wish to work on over the coming weeks and Christmas as I cannot finish this degree at a good standard with my current attitude. I am getting back on track and will do my best to not let what happened over the past couple of weeks happen again.

##Week Ten

The essay and research journals deadlines are next Monday. The comp210 project is non-existent I'm not sure how I'm going to go about doing it, I will speak to my tutor to see how I could go about getting it done. Where the research journals are concerned I wrote them on the weekend, though I could have written more for both of them, I honestly have begun losing my patience with reading academic research, that along with the lack of time. It has come to my attention that time management will be a constant struggle throughout my life, the best I can do is to do my best, at trying to keep myself organised. where the essay is concerned I have added the results and conclusion which finished off the paper nicely, mu only regret with this paper is that I did not get the survey out soon enough and push it on people to complete. Perhaps next time I shall get some artists to provide the examples needed for the survey to have a more accurate representation of the female body that I was trying to achieve.

##Week Eleven

My deadlines for my practical projects are next Monday. The comp210 project is little more than a design document, which the tutor advised was the wiser path as time had now ran out to create a physical artefact. The main cause for this as I see it was the lack of parts available for us to use for the interface. The comp220 has been difficult I could not get my head around OpenGL and the tutorials online were less than helpful. In the end all I had was a black ball, the code for lighting, texturing and loading .obj files is there, just getting them to function correctly seemed to be beyond my current ability. This has been difficult to live with as I like to at least keep up with others and not fall behind. On the other hand comp230 has gone great, I have really enjoyed working with my team on project VoT and I have no worries about the module.

##Week Twelve 

So we come to the end of the first semester, it has been an interesting journey; a lot has happened with myself and the company. I believe that self motivation is something that I need to keep in sight at all times. I need to stop locking myself away and start being open with my thoughts and try to keep everything flowing forward. This way it should keep my life going smoothly, though I may not have done as well as I had hoped for comp210-220 I can rest assured that my comp230 has been a success. The next step is to keep in mind that I’m not alone in this and that relying on others for help is always something that can be done.
